## üìñ Introduction

This capstone project proposes building an AI-powered agent that automates the collection, classification, summarization, and impact evaluation of financial news articles by economic sectors such as technology, healthcare, energy, and finance.

The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models to:

- Automatically collect news from various financial RSS sources.
- Classify each article by economic sector using domain-specific NLP techniques.
- Summarize key content using both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.
- Analyze market data to assess potential impact on stock prices.
- Present all results in Vietnamese for improved accessibility to local investors.

This solution aims to assist retail investors and financial analysts in quickly grasping sector-specific developments and making data-driven decisions.
