## 1) Project Overview

- **Objective:** To automate the processing of financial news by **sector** and quantify its impact on **stock prices**, supporting faster and more informed investment decisions.

- **Problem:** The vast, noisy, and unstructured flow of market information makes manual monitoring and processing inefficient, often leading to delayed reactions and missed opportunities.

- **Solution:** A comprehensive AI-driven system that:
    -   Automatically **crawls** news from multiple reputable Vietnamese sources.
    -   **Summarizes** articles concisely using abstractive models (**ViT5**).
    -   **Classifies** news into sectors (Technology, Energy, Healthcare, Finance) and analyzes **sentiment** (Positive, Neutral, Negative) using **PhoBERT** and **XLM-Roberta**.
    -   **Forecasts** short-term stock price trends by integrating news sentiment with historical price data using **LSTM/GRU** models.
    -   Presents all analyzed information through an intuitive **web dashboard**.

**‚úÖ Outcome:** A fully functional web system with an automated ETL + AI pipeline, a responsive dashboard, and near real-time data updates.

---

## 2) Key Features

-   **Automated News Aggregation:** Continuous crawling from multiple financial news sources.
-   **Intelligent Summarization:** Generates concise Vietnamese summaries focusing on key information using fine-tuned **ViT5**.
-   **Sector-Wise Classification:** Automatically categorizes news into **Technology, Energy, Healthcare, Finance**.
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies the tone of news articles as **Positive, Neutral, or Negative**.
-   **Price Trend Forecasting:** Provides short-term stock price forecasts using **LSTM/GRU** models enhanced with news sentiment features.
-   **Personalization:** Bookmark articles, manage watchlists, and receive customizable alerts.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** Manage news sources, crawling schedules, users, and monitor the AI pipeline health.

## 3) System Architecture

The system is designed with a modular, cloud-ready architecture for scalability and maintainability.

**üîß Components:**

*   **Frontend (ReactJS):** Hosted on **Vercel**. Provides the user interface for dashboard, search, filtering, and visualization.
*   **Backend API (Python/Flask):** Hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**. Handles business logic, user authentication, and serves processed data from the cache or database.
*   **AI & ETL Pipeline (Python):** Deployed on **DigitalOcean Droplets**. Responsible for:
    *   Data collection using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**.
    *   Data preprocessing, normalization, and deduplication.
    *   Running AI models (Summarization, Classification, Sentiment).
    *   Feature engineering and storing results in the database.
*   **Data Layer:**
    *   **Supabase (PostgreSQL):** Primary persistent database for storing all processed news, stock prices, and user data.
    *   **Redis:** Serves as a high-performance cache layer to speed up API responses and queue background tasks.
*   **Orchestration:** **n8n** is used for workflow automation, such as refreshing cache data.

**üîÅ Data Flow:**
1.  The ETL pipeline crawls and processes data, then stores it in Supabase.
2.  Processed data is loaded into Redis for fast access.
3.  User requests hit the Backend API, which first checks Redis (cache) for data.
4.  If data is not in cache (cache miss), the API fetches it from Supabase.
5.  The API returns structured data (JSON) to the Frontend for rendering.

*(Refer to **Figure 40: System Data Flow Diagram** in the project document for a detailed visualization)*

## 4) Data Pipeline

**üì• Data Sources:**
-   **News:** CafeF, PetroTimes, MarketTimes, Di·ªÖn ƒë√†n Doanh nghi·ªáp, Chungta, IMEXPHARM.
-   **Stock Prices:** Simplize.

**‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps:**
1.  **Collection:** Automated crawling using Selenium WebDriver and parsing with BeautifulSoup.
2.  **Validation & Deduplication:** Check for duplicates based on URL and content hash.
3.  **Cleaning:** Remove HTML tags, advertisements, footers, and special characters. Normalize Unicode (NFC) and whitespace.
4.  **Normalization:** Standardize text (lowercasing, diacritic handling where suitable).
5.  **Labeling:** Semi-automatic labeling for sector and sentiment using LLM suggestions followed by manual correction.
6.  **Integration:** Merge news data with stock price data based on timestamp and stock ticker.

---

## 5) Training

**üìä Datasets:**
-   **General News Dataset:** ~12,000 Vietnamese news records with `title`, `content`, `summary`, `industry`, and `sentiment` labels.
-   **Ticker-specific News:** Processed news mapped to specific stock tickers (FPT, GAS, VCB, IMP).
-   **Stock Price Data:** Daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
